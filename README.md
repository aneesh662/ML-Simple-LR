# Experience vs Salary Machine Learning Simple Linear Regression 
# Project Overview

This project demonstrates a simple linear regression model using Streamlit to predict salaries based on years of experience. The model is trained on a dataset and provides real-time predictions and visualizations through a web application.

# Objective: Predict salary based on years of experience using a simple linear regression model.
# Libraries Used:
pandas for data handling
numpy for numerical operations
matplotlib for plotting
scikit-learn for creating and evaluating the linear regression model
streamlit for creating the web application


The dataset used in this project is a CSV file named Experience Salary.csv containing the following columns:

Experience: Years of experience
Salary: Annual salary in USD
Example data:
# Data Set
Experience Salary.csv



# Features

Predict Salary: Input years of experience to get the predicted salary.
Visualize Data: See a scatter plot of the dataset with the regression line fitted to it.
Model Metrics: View the model's accuracy, coefficient, and intercept.
Code Explanation

# Data Loading: 
  Uses pandas to load and cache the dataset.
# Model Training: 
  Trains a LinearRegression model from scikit-learn using the training data.
# Prediction: 
  Allows users to input years of experience and get salary predictions.
# Visualization: 
  Uses matplotlib to display the regression line and data points.
